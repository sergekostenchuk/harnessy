  - "Every test file finishes under the standard npm test command on Windows with zero failures and no hangs; platform-only skips are documented and meaningful."

## Steps

1. Reproduce and group the 93 failed and four timed-out test files by root cause. Distinguish Windows product defects from nonportable test fixtures and the audit runner's credential isolation.
2. Repair common fixture and runner problems first: CLI processes, Electron launch, symlink test setup, teardown, and path assertions. Verify each group with targeted tests before broadening.
3. Repair actual Windows product defects revealed by the suite, preserving file identity, path boundaries, and other security invariants. Add focused regressions where behavior changes.
4. Run `npm test` to completion on Windows, then test the packaged app with isolated data and check the full Windows/macOS CI matrix.
5. Obtain independent Claude review, address findings, update the draft PR and HANDOFF, and report the remaining external provider-policy gate.
