  - "Windows startup does not emit Autopilot ledger errors; enabling Autopilot returns an explicit unsupported result until its decision ledger has a Windows security implementation."

## Steps

1. Restore reproducible dependency installation and capture the baseline Windows failures.
2. Add platform-aware program path and CLI discovery while preserving macOS behaviour.
3. Make desktop preparation and packaging work on Windows, with existing security guards intact.
4. Run focused tests, package smoke test, and inspect the diff for platform regressions.
5. Submit the complete diff for independent review and prepare a compact proposal for Sergey.
